# Tutorial: yfinance

`yfinance` is a popular Python library that makes it incredibly *easy* to download historical and real-time financial market data from Yahoo Finance. The core of the library is the **`Ticker` object**, which acts as a gateway to all information for a specific stock, like `MSFT`. You can use it to fetch everything from historical prices to financial statements, or even download data for **multiple tickers at once**.
